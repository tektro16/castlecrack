<h1>This is my website.</h1>

<p>I made this website using MacOS's terminal and multiple tools. Mainly Jekyll. <br />
Jekyll is a program that makes static pages accessible to anybody. It converts html to human languge and human language to html.</p>

<p>I want to say thank you to Amanda Visconti, without her I would've never made this website.<br />
She wrote the course [Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages][Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages] which guides you to every step in the making of your site.<br />
Check it out if you want to make your own! </p>

<p>Thank you to [The Programming Historian][The Programming Historian] website and all their members.<br />
You introduced me to my first command line. And made me curious to learn more.Thank you for all the work you're doing.</p>
